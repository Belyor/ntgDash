Layout
~~~~~~
When you first open the application in your web browser, you'll see a page which is divided into 3 diffrent parts:

1. **Graph picker** (left green panel) - this is the panel which contains options (their functionalities are described in the next paragraph) for choosing types of graphs you want to display,
2. **Filters** (right blue panel) - a panel in which you filter the data files you want to use in your data analisis,
3. **List of graphs** (bottom panel) - at the beginning, this panel has only an empty dropdown. After adding graphs using options from graph picker new graphs will be displayed below the dropdown.
